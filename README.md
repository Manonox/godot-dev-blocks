# Godot Dev Blocks

![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/SpVzN2I.png)


**A set of devblocks, configured for Kenney's prototype textures**

This package includes 3 types of customizable dev blocks and 13 development/prototype textures each in 6 different
colors.

Dev blocks scale their texture uvs with themselves, so the texture doesn't cut off at specific intervals.

See [this page](https://kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures) for the full
package that also contains vectors.
